# Mood & Weather To-Do App (Metana Bootcamp)

This repository is the ongoing full-stack project for the Metana bootcamp. The app will evolve over multiple modules from a static UI into a functional full-stack application with task management, mood-based suggestions, and weather-based suggestions powered by a Weather API.

## Module Roadmap
- **Week 01:** Repo setup, structure, documentation, and workflow
- **Week 02:** Static front end (HTML/CSS) based on the prototype
- **Week 03:** App logic (JavaScript): create/edit/complete/delete tasks
- **Week 04:** Backend + APIs: server setup and Weather API integration

## Repo Structure
- `public/` – static assets and `index.html`
- `src/` – application logic (JavaScript)
- `docs/` – planning notes and documentation

## Getting Started (Week 01)
For now, this project is in setup mode.
- Open `public/index.html` in a browser to confirm the project loads.
